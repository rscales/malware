# malware
Service for maintaining and validating against a known set of malware url's

The malware url validation service provides a lookup service to determine if a given URL domain has been flagged to be a source of maleware.  The WEB API consists of a single service based on passing the url as part of the query.

	http://localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo?url=<domain based url>

In order to run the service it will be necessary to have the go runtime environment installed on the target system.  To run the service from the command line, perform following steps:

	cd validation_service
	go install .
	$GOBIN/validation_service

The server will be bound to port 8080 on localhost by default
	
Once the service is running, the curl tool can be used to send requests to the server.
If running in zsh, it is necessary to use quotations around the entire request,

	example: curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo?url=www.yahoo.com"
